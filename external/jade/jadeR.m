function B =  jadeR(X,m)
%   B = jadeR(X, m) is an m*n matrix such that Y=B*X are separated sources
%    extracted from the n*T data matrix X.
%   If m is omitted,  B=jadeR(X)  is a square n*n matrix (as many sources as sensors)
%
% Blind separation of real signals with JADE.  Version 1.8.   May 2005.
%
% Usage: 
%   * If X is an nxT data matrix (n sensors, T samples) then
%     B=jadeR(X) is a nxn separating matrix such that S=B*X is an nxT
%     matrix of estimated source signals.
%   * If B=jadeR(X,m), then B has size mxn so that only m sources are
%     extracted.  This is done by restricting the operation of jadeR
%     to the m first principal components. 
%   * Also, the rows of B are ordered such that the columns of pinv(B)
%     are in order of decreasing norm; this has the effect that the
%     `most energetically significant' components appear first in the
%     rows of S=B*X.
%
% Quick notes (more at the end of this file)
%
%  o this code is for REAL-valued signals.  An implementation of JADE
%    for both real and complex signals is also available from
%    http://sig.enst.fr/~cardoso/stuff.html
%
%  o This algorithm differs from the first released implementations of
%    JADE in that it has been optimized to deal more efficiently
%    1) with real signals (as opposed to complex)
%    2) with the case when the ICA model does not necessarily hold.
%
%  o There is a practical limit to the number of independent
%    components that can be extracted with this implementation.  Note
%    that the first step of JADE amounts to a PCA with dimensionality
%    reduction from n to m (which defaults to n).  In practice m
%    cannot be `very large' (more than 40, 50, 60... depending on
%    available memory)
%
%  o See more notes, references and revision history at the end of
%    this file and more stuff on the WEB
%    http://sig.enst.fr/~cardoso/stuff.html
%
%  o This code is supposed to do a good job!  Please report any
%    problem to cardoso@sig.enst.fr

% To do.
%   - Implement a cheaper/simpler whitening (is it worth it?)
% 
% Revision history:
%
%- V1.8, May 2005
%  - Added some commented code to explain the cumulant computation tricks.
%  - Added reference to the Neural Comp. paper.
%
%-  V1.7, Nov. 16, 2002
%   - Reverted the mean removal code to an earlier version (not using 
%     repmat) to keep the code octave-compatible.  Now less efficient,
%     but does not make any significant difference wrt the total 
%     computing cost.
%   - Remove some cruft (some debugging figures were created.  What 
%     was this stuff doing there???)
%
%
%-  V1.6, Feb. 24, 1997 
%   - Mean removal is better implemented.
%   - Transposing X before computing the cumulants: small speed-up
%   - Still more comments to emphasize the relationship to PCA
%
%-  V1.5, Dec. 24 1997 
%   - The sign of each row of B is determined by letting the first element be positive.
%
%-  V1.4, Dec. 23 1997 
%   - Minor clean up.
%   - Added a verbose switch
%   - Added the sorting of the rows of B in order to fix in some reasonable way the
%     permutation indetermination.  See note 2) below.
%
%-  V1.3, Nov.  2 1997 
%   - Some clean up.  Released in the public domain.
%
%-  V1.2, Oct.  5 1997 
%   - Changed random picking of the cumulant matrix used for initialization to a
%     deterministic choice.  This is not because of a better rationale but to make the
%     ouput (almost surely) deterministic.
%   - Rewrote the joint diag. to take more advantage of Matlab's tricks.
%   - Created more dummy variables to combat Matlab's loose memory management.
%
%-  V1.1, Oct. 29 1997.
%    Made the estimation of the cumulant matrices more regular. This also corrects a
%    buglet...
%
%-  V1.0, Sept. 9 1997. Created.

%  Notes:
%  ======
%
%  Note 1) The original Jade algorithm/code deals with complex signals in Gaussian noise
%  white and exploits an underlying assumption that the model of independent components
%  actually holds.  This is a reasonable assumption when dealing with some narrowband
%  signals.  In this context, one may i) seriously consider dealing precisely with the
%  noise in the whitening process and ii) expect to use the small number of significant
%  eigenmatrices to efficiently summarize all the 4th-order information.  All this is done
%  in the JADE algorithm.
%
%  In *this* implementation, we deal with real-valued signals and we do NOT expect the ICA
%  model to hold exactly.  Therefore, it is pointless to try to deal precisely with the
%  additive noise and it is very unlikely that the cumulant tensor can be accurately
%  summarized by its first n eigen-matrices.  Therefore, we consider the joint
%  diagonalization of the *whole* set of eigen-matrices.  However, in such a case, it is
%  not necessary to compute the eigenmatrices at all because one may equivalently use
%  `parallel slices' of the cumulant tensor.  This part (computing the eigen-matrices) of
%  the computation can be saved: it suffices to jointly diagonalize a set of cumulant
%  matrices.  Also, since we are dealing with reals signals, it becomes easier to exploit
%  the symmetries of the cumulants to further reduce the number of matrices to be
%  diagonalized.  These considerations, together with other cheap tricks lead to this
%  version of JADE which is optimized (again) to deal with real mixtures and to work
%  `outside the model'.  As the original JADE algorithm, it works by minimizing a `good
%  set' of cumulants.
%
%
%  Note 2) The rows of the separating matrix B are resorted in such a way that the columns
%  of the corresponding mixing matrix A=pinv(B) are in decreasing order of (Euclidian)
%  norm.  This is a simple, `almost canonical' way of fixing the indetermination of
%  permutation.  It has the effect that the first rows of the recovered signals (ie the
%  first rows of B*X) correspond to the most energetic *components*.  Recall however that
%  the source signals in S=B*X have unit variance.  Therefore, when we say that the
%  observations are unmixed in order of decreasing energy, this energetic signature is to
%  be found as the norm of the columns of A=pinv(B) and not as the variances of the
%  separated source signals.
%
%
%  Note 3) In experiments where JADE is run as B=jadeR(X,m) with m varying in range of
%  values, it is nice to be able to test the stability of the decomposition.  In order to
%  help in such a test, the rows of B can be sorted as described above. We have also
%  decided to fix the sign of each row in some arbitrary but fixed way.  The convention is
%  that the first element of each row of B is positive.
%
%
%  Note 4) Contrary to many other ICA algorithms, JADE (or least this version) does not
%  operate on the data themselves but on a statistic (the full set of 4th order cumulant).
%  This is represented by the matrix CM below, whose size grows as m^2 x m^2 where m is
%  the number of sources to be extracted (m could be much smaller than n).  As a
%  consequence, (this version of) JADE will probably choke on a `large' number of sources.
%  Here `large' depends mainly on the available memory and could be something like 40 or
%  so.  One of these days, I will prepare a version of JADE taking the `data' option
%  rather than the `statistic' option.
