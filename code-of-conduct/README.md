# OSET's Code of Conduct

Users of OSET and welcome and invited to contribute to this codebase. Adherence to the following Code of Conduct ensures that OSET remains a valuable and reliable resource for the biomedical engineering and biomedical informatics communities.

1. **Commitment to open science:** All contributors and users of OSET are expected to uphold the principles of open science, ensuring that their work is accessible, reproducible, and transparent.

1. **Coding guidelines:** Source codes for biomedical signal processing applications, require adherence to coding styles beyond the common practices recommended in the software engineering community. Some good coding practices that OSET source codes are expected to adhere to are available [here](https://github.com/alphanumericslab/reusable-bsp-ml-coding).

1. **Inclusivity and collaboration:** OSET promotes an inclusive environment where contributors from diverse backgrounds are welcomed. Collaborative efforts are encouraged to maintain a community-driven approach to development.

1. **Quality and integrity in development:** Developers must adhere to high standards of quality. This includes thorough testing, accurate documentation, and maintaining the integrity of the codebase. All contributions should aim to enhance the functionality and usability of OSET.

1. **Respect for intellectual property:** OSET is provided with a permissive open license. While encouraging open-source contributions, OSET respects intellectual property rights of contributors. Contributors must ensure that their submissions do not infringe upon the rights of others and should appropriately credit any external resources or inspirations.

1. **Data privacy and ethics:** Any handling of data within OSET should comply with ethical standards and respect user privacy. This is particularly important when dealing with sensitive or personal health data. Any sample data shared on OSET must be fully deidentified.

1. **OSET is not a data hosting reporsitory:** Short sample records are merely hosted to serve as proof of concept and facilitate testing and debugging the codebase.

1. **Constructive communication:** All interactions within the OSET community and its Q&A forums, should be conducted respectfully and constructively. Harassment, discrimination, and offensive behavior are not tolerated.

1. **Adherence to scientific rigor:** Contributions should be scientifically sound. This includes using validated methods, adhering to established biomedical data processing standards, and staying updated with current research. Citation of scholary research that support the algorithm implementations hosted on OSET are mandatory. 

1. **Responsibility in reporting:** Users and contributors should responsibly report any issues, errors, or vulnerabilities in OSET to the project maintainers promptly, aiding in continuous improvement.

1. **Sustainability:** Contributions should consider the long-term sustainability of OSET, including backward compatibility, future scalability, and potential integration with emerging technologies.

1. **Educational contribution:** OSET is set to serve as a training resource. Contributors are encouraged to provide educational resources, examples, tutorials, and other learning materials to support the training and development of users, particularly those new to biomedical signal processing.
