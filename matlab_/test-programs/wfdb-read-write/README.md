# Comparing different tools for reading and writing WFDB compatible data files in C, MATLAB and Python

### Requirements
1. The WFDB software package in C: https://physionet.org/content/wfdb/10.7.0/ (https://github.com/bemoody/wfdb)
2. The Waveform Database Software Package (WFDB) for Python: https://physionet.org/content/wfdb-python/4.1.0/ (https://github.com/MIT-LCP/wfdb-python)
3. The Waveform Database Software Package (WFDB) for MATLAB and Octave: https://physionet.org/content/wfdb-matlab/0.10.0/ (https://github.com/ikarosilva/wfdb-app-toolbox)
4. WFDBCheck: https://github.com/bemoody/wfdbcheck

### Procedure
1. Run [prepare_sample_record.m](prepare_sample_record.m) in MATLAB to prepare a sample record in `.mat` and `.csv` formats, to be used for comparison. The sample record is assumed to have physical units.
1. Run [test_wfdb_read_write_matlab.m](test_wfdb_read_write_matlab.m) in MATLAB to convert the sample record to WFDB `.dat` and `.hea` files using `mat2wfdb`. This code compares two approaches: A) running `mat2wfdb` with the original physical units and allowing the function to select the correct scaling and baseline (`.dat` and `.hea` files with `mat2wfdb` postfix); B) scaling the signal to 16 bits using [DataScalingQuantization.m](DataScalingQuantization.m) and using the gain and baseline provided by this function (`.dat` and `.hea` files with `mat2wfdb_digital` postfix). The function also calculates the channel-wise gains and baseline values to be used in the C and Python versions.
2. [test_wfdb_read_write_matlab.m](test_wfdb_read_write_matlab.m) also saves the raw data matrix in CSV format, which is used by the other tools. 
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook [test_wfdb_read_write_python.ipynb](test_wfdb_read_write_python.ipynb), which runs the `csv_to_wfdb()` function from `wfdb-python` and generates the corresponding `.dat` and `.hea` files with `wfdbpython` postfix. 
4. Run the Bash script [test_wfdb_read_write_wrsamp.sh](test_wfdb_read_write_wrsamp.sh) in the terminal that runs `wrsamp` from the WFDB C version and generates the corresponding `.dat` and `.hea` files with `wrsamp` postfix
5. Run [test_compare_wfdb_conversions.sh](test_compare_wfdb_conversions.sh) to run `rdsamp`, which converts the different `.dat` and `.hea` versions generated above back to CSV format and also runs `wfdbcheck` to make sure that the data formats are correct to be exported to the PhysioNet database.

*Notes*:
- Run `chmod +x test_wfdb_read_write_wrsamp.sh` and `chmod +x test_compare_wfdb_conversions.sh` to grant execute permissions to the Bash scripts
- Make sure to update the paths to your Python packages when running the Jupyter Notebook


### Conclusion (under study)
1. The `wrsamp` C version doesn't support the `baseline` parameter.
2. When `baseline` is non-zero, we occasionally get out-of-range and checksum errors in the Python version (needs further investigation)
3. Setting `baseline=0` and using the same gains and baselines generated by [test_wfdb_read_write_matlab.m](test_wfdb_read_write_matlab.m), `wrsamp` (in C) and `csv_to_wfdb()` (in Python) exactly generate the same results after conversion by `rdsamp`
4. When `baseline=0`, `mat2wfdb` in the digital mode (with `mat2wfdb_digital` postfix) almost perfectly matches the results from `wrsamp` and `csv_to_wfdb()`. The sample reconstruction errors are within +/-1 in 16-bits, which is only the rounding error.
5. `wrsamp` (in C) without providing the gains does not match after reconstruction
6. `mat2wfdb` (in MATLAB) has an issue when `baseline=32767` (there seems to be an internal overflow)
