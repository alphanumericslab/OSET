function [phase, phasepos] = PhaseCalculation(peaks)
%
% [phase phasepos] = PhaseCalculation(peaks)
% ECG phase calculation from a given set of R-peaks.
%
% input:
% peaks: vector of R-peak pulse train
%
% outputs:
% phase: the calculated phases ranging from -pi to pi. The R-peaks are
% located at phase = 0.
% phasepos: the calculated phases ranging from 0 to 2*pi. The R-peaks are
% again located at phasepos = 0.
