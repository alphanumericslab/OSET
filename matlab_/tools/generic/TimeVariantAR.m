% Time variant auto-regressive(AR) model estimated by Kalman Filter and Kalman Smoother
%
% inputs:
% data: template noise used for model training
% order: AR model order
% x0: a time-invariant set of AR-coefficients estimated by applying a
%     global AR-model estimation on the entire input signal
% q: AR coefficients covariance
% R: noise variance
% p0: covariance of the KF initial state
% alpha: KF forgetting factor (alpha=1 for standard KF)
%
% outputs:
% ARCoefsKF: AR coefficients estimated by a Kalman Filter
% ARCoefsKS: AR coefficients estimated by a Kalman Smoother
