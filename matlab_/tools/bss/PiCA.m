function [y,W,A] = PiCA(x,peaks,varargin)
%
% [y,W,A] = PiCA(x,peaks1,peaks2)
% Pseudo-Periodic Component Analysis
%
% input:
% x: input data array (channels x samples)
% peaks1: vector of first signal peaks impulse train (R-wave locations for ECG signals)
% peaks2 (optional): vector of second signal peaks impulse train (R-wave locations for ECG signals)
%
% outputs:
% y: pseudo-periodic components ranked in order of resemblance with the
% first to second (if available) desired signals.
% W: the decomposition matrix
% A: the mixing matrix
%
% comment: if the signal peaks2 is not available the components are ranked
% from the most similar to the least similar to the signal with
% corresponding to peaks1.
