function y = BPFilter6(x,fc,bw, factor)
%
% y = BPFilter6(x,fc,bw,order),
% Bandpass filter using an equiripple FIR filter
%
% inputs:
% x: vector or matrix of input data (channels x samples)
% fc: normalized center frequency
% bw: normalized bandwidth
% factor: controls the sharpness of the filter and its convergence (0 < factor < 1)
%
% output:
% y: vector or matrix of filtered data (channels x samples)
%
% Note:
% - fc and bw are the center frequency and bandwidth of the bandpass filter
% normalized by the sampling frequency
