function stm = amp_seq_to_stm(amplitude_sequence)
% amp_seq_to_stm - Generates a state transition matrix (STM) from amplitude 
%   fluctuations of a time-series. Useful for detecting periodic QRS amplitude
%   fluctuations or T-wave Alternans (TWA) from ECG data.
% 
% Usage:
%   stm = amp_seq_to_stm(amplitude_sequence)
% 
% Inputs:
%   amplitude_sequence - A numeric vector representing the amplitude sequence
%                        from a time-series data set, typically ECG data.
%
% Outputs:
%   stm - 2x2 state transition matrix that represents the transitions
%         between high and low states in the amplitude sequence.
%
%       stm(1,1): Low-to-Low transitions
%       stm(1,2): Low-to-High transitions
%       stm(2,1): High-to-Low transitions
%       stm(2,2): High-to-High transitions
% Note:
%   output STM can be converted to an estimate of high-low amplitude 
%   probabilities by the following normalization:
%   STM = diag(1./sum(stm, 2))*stm;
% 
% Example 1: White noise
%   stm = amp_seq_to_stm(randn(1, 10000)); % STM converges to [1/3, 2/3 ; 2/3, 1/3] for long
% sequences
% 
% Example 2: Wiener process
%   stm = amp_seq_to_stm(cumsum(randn(1, 10000))); % STM converges to [0.5, 0.5 ; 0.5, 0.5] for long
% sequences
% 
% Example 3: Periodic process
%   stm = amp_seq_to_stm(mod(1:10000, 2)); % STM is [0, 1 ; 1, 0]
