function [y, W, A] = periodic_component_analysis(x, peaks1, varargin)
% periodic_component_analysis - Pseudo-Periodic Component Analysis (PiCA).
%   Extracts and ranks sources in order of resemblance with
%   pseudo-periodic events (such as ECG) with one or two sets of cyclic
%   peaks, from multichannel data
%
% Usage:
%   [y, W, A] = periodic_component_analysis(x, peaks1, peaks2, mode)
%
% Inputs:
%   x: Input data array (channels x samples).
%   peaks1: Vector of first signal peaks impulse train (R-wave locations
%       for ECG signals).
%   peaks2 (optional): Vector of second signal peaks impulse train (R-wave
%       locations for ECG signals).
%   mode (optional): Mode indicating the behavior of the algorithm:
%        0: Single-peak case, components ranked based on
%           resemblance to peaks1 periodicity. (default mode if only one peak is selected)
%        1: Two-peak case, components ranked based on resemblance to
%           peaks1 - peaks2. (default mode if two peaks are given as input)
%        2: Two-peak case, blending from similarity with peaks1 to peaks2.
%
% Outputs:
%   y: Pseudo-periodic components ranked in order of resemblance with the
%       first to second (if available) desired signals.
%   W: Decomposition (separation) matrix.
%   A: Mixing matrix.
%
% Note: If the signal peaks2 is not available, the components are ranked
%   from the most similar to the least similar to the signal corresponding to
%   peaks1.
