% Baseline wander extraction from biomedical recordings, using two stages 
% of median or moving average filtering.
%
% inputs:
% x: vector or matrix of noisy data (channels x samples)
% L1: first stage averaging window length (in samples)
% L2: second stage averaging window length (in samples)
% approach:
%   'md': median filtering
%   'mn': moving average
%
% output:
% b: vector or matrix of baseline wanders (channels x samples)
