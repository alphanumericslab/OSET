# EEG-PhaseFreq-Analysis
Cerebral Signal's Instantaneous Parameters (Phase, Frequency &amp; Envelope) Estimation &amp; Analysis MATLAB Toolbox

This document (link provided above) is meant to help individuals use the "Cerebral Signal Phase Analysis" toolbox which implements different methods for estimating the instantaneous phase and frequency of a signal and calculating some related popular quantities. The latest version of toolbox documentation can be downloaded directly at the address:
	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02249v3.pdf

The toolbox – which is distributed under the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE as a set of MATLAB routines – can be downloaded at the address:
