# OSET Tools in Python

## Installing

To use the OSET Python package, follow these steps according to your system's Python release:

### Setting up a Virtual Environment using Conda

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Create a new virtual environment using Conda. Replace `<venv_name>` with your desired name for the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n <venv_name> python=3.10 --file requirements.txt
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate <venv_name>
   ```

### Setting up a Virtual Environment using Native Python (venv)

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your project (where `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` are located).

3. Create a new virtual environment using the built-in `venv` module. Replace `<venv_name>` with your desired name for the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv <venv_name>
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     <venv_name>\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source <venv_name>/bin/activate
     ```

### Building and installing the OSET package on the Virtual Environment (tested on MacOS)

After activating the venv, make sure to have `poetry` installed. If not, run:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Now build the OSET package:

```bash
poetry build
```

With the virtual environment activated (as explained above), you can now install the OSET package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install .
```

After installation, you can check if the package is correctly installed in the virtual environment:

```bash
pip list
```

### Building and installing the OSET package on the Virtual Environment (tested on Windows)
Make sure all the package subfolders have a `__init__.py` file. Now build the OSET package:

```bash
python -m build
```
With the virtual environment activated (as explained above), you can now install the OSET package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install .
```

After installation, you can check if the package is correctly installed in the virtual environment:

```bash
pip list
```

### Uninstalling

To uninstall the OSET package, use the following command:

```bash
pip uninstall oset
```

Replace `<venv_name>` with the name of the virtual environment where you installed OSET.

After uninstallation, verify that the package is fully removed by rechecking the installed packages using `pip list`. If you previously had a different version installed, uninstalling will revert to the previous version.

The virtual environment can be deactivated as follows:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

And it can be deleted using:

```bash
conda remove --name <venv_name> --all
```

## Jupyter

Install Jupyter on the virtual environment:

```bash
conda install jupyterlab
```

After activating the created virtual environment, install its kernel:

```bash
ipython kernel install --user --name=<venv_name>
```

Launch `jupyter-notebook` or `jupyter-lab` after activating the virtual environment. Select the `<venv_name>` kernel from the Kernels tab.

Check in the Jupyter terminal to make sure that `oset` is installed (`pip list` or `conda list`). If not, install OSET from the Jupyter terminal.

## Usage

After successfully installing the OSET package in your virtual environment, you can use it in your Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks:

```python
from oset.generic.tanh_saturation import tanh_saturation

# Your code using the oset package
```

Please note that you need to activate the virtual environment (as explained above) whenever you want to work with the OSET package.
