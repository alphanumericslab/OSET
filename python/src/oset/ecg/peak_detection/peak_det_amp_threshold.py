    peak_det_amp_threshold - R-peak detector based on max search and level thresholding

    Syntax: peaks, peak_indexes = peak_det_amp_threshold(x, ff, th, *args)

    Inputs:
      x: Vector of input data.
      ff: Approximate ECG beat-rate in Hertz, normalized by the sampling frequency.
      th: Peaks smaller than this fraction of the max peak amplitude are neglected.
      flag (optional): Search for positive (flag=1) or negative (flag=0) peaks. By default,
                  the maximum absolute value of the signal determines the peak sign.

    Outputs:
      peaks: Vector of R-peak impulse train.
      peak_indexes: Indexes of the detected R-peaks.

    Notes:
    - The R-peaks are found from a peak search in windows of length N, where
      N corresponds to the R-peak period calculated from the given ff. R-peaks
      with periods smaller than N/2 or greater than N are not detected.
    - The signal baseline wander is recommended to be removed before the
      R-peak detection.
