function y = BPFilter2(x,fl,fu,N)
%
% y = BPFilter2(x,fl,fu,N),
% Bandpass filter using FFT filtering with variable FFT points
%
% inputs:
% x: vector or matrix of input data (channels x samples)
% fl: normalized lower frequency
% fu: normalized upper frequency
% N: number of FFT points
%
% output:
% y: vector or matrix of filtered data (channels x samples)
%
% Note:
% - fl and fu are the lower and upper frequency ranges of the bandpass filter
% normalized by the sampling frequency
% - The filter does not perform any windowing on the data
